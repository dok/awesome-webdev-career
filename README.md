## An opinionated guide for starting your career as a web developer

### Before getting started

1. Install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  - Install node with nvm (nvm install 4.0)
3. Install Chrome

### Directions

1. Learn Javascript
  - Your foundation of web development starts with a strong understanding of Javascript.
  - You can start learning about Javascript through [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
  - **Extra:** Extend your knowledge of Javascript. It helps if you have a consistent style in how you write code.
    - Reading the [Airbnb Javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
    - Complete the [Javascript Koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)
    - Learn about [prototype inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). This is will help you to understand how your code can be abstracted and reused across multiple locations.
    - Write [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) from scratch. This will help you because it allows you to understand some of the most basic functional utility tools that is used in Javascript.
2. Learn HTML and CSS
  - You will learn about how websites are work in the structural sense.
  - Start [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
  - Learn to use the [Chrome devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/videos). This will help you understand & debug your code.
3. Make a little website of your own
  - Doesn't have to be a large website. Just something that tells others about yourself.
  - Doesn't need to have a backend. Don't worry about servers and related issues for now.
  - **Requirements**
    - Host your site on github.io. Learn how to do that [here](https://pages.github.com/)
    - Have a project with an index.html
    - Must have some CSS
4. Write a little chat application with a server
  - Why do you need to learn about the backend? So that you can have users/computers communicate with each other through the central location (the server).
  - You can use any technology you want. Node.js, python, php. I would start with Node because you already know Javascript.
  - **Requirements**
    1. When you go to a url, the website should return the string 'hello world'.
    2. Afterwards, have it serve your website you created with step 3.
    3. Go as far as you want with this.
      - Create a site with different routes (/about, /contact, etc.)
5. Learn about databases
  - Why do you need to learn about databases? So that you can store stuff.
  - Learn about [SQL](http://sqlzoo.net/)
  - Learn about [MongoDb](http://openmymind.net/2011/3/28/The-Little-MongoDB-Book/)
